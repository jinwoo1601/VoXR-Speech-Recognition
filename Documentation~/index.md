# VoXR Speech Recognition

Offline speech recognition and voice command parsing for Unity XR applications. Wraps the [VOSK](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) toolkit behind a Unity-native C# API with native audio capture on Android arm64 and live microphone capture in the Unity Editor on Windows.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md) -- Installation, model setup, quick start examples, and the recognition lifecycle
- [Command Recognition](command-recognition.md) -- How utterances become commands: the full parsing pipeline from audio to events, pending commands, slot resolvers, and what to do when two commands are too alike to tell apart

## Guides

- [Matching and Scoring](scoring.md) -- The score formula and its miss costs, coverage, selection order, the leading-required-miss bar, the two gates, eager-flush verdicts, and how to read a session log
- [Command Sets](command-sets.md) -- Runtime mode switching with named command groups and grammar management
- [Inspector Authoring](inspector-authoring.md) -- Zero-code setup using ScriptableObject assets in the Unity Inspector
- [Editor Testing](editor-testing.md) -- Debug window, session debug log, live microphone, text injection, and batch test runner
- [Push-to-Talk and Error Handling](push-to-talk.md) -- Push-to-talk pattern, error handling, and the error code reference
