## Common Issues

### "Model archive not found in StreamingAssets"

Ensure the model `.zip` is at `Assets/StreamingAssets/<modelName>.zip` where `<modelName>` matches the `modelRelativePath` field on the `VoxrSpeechRecogniser` component. The default path expects `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip`.

A sibling message reporting that the archive **could not be read**, with the underlying reason appended, means the file is where it should be but the SDK could not get its bytes -- a locked or permission-denied file, or running out of memory materialising the array. Both arrive as `ModelLoadFailed`, and both are raised only when there is no valid extracted cache to fall back on: where one exists it is used, with only its freshness left unchecked. See [Model Validation](getting-started.md#model-validation).

### "Microphone permission (RECORD_AUDIO) was not granted"

Add `RECORD_AUDIO` to your Android manifest or enable it in Player Settings > Android > Other Settings. The SDK requests the permission at runtime, but the manifest entry must be present for the request to succeed.

### No transcription output on Quest

- Run the [Voice Check sample](../Samples~/VoiceCheck/README.md) first -- it tells the two failures apart. A flat meter means no audio is reaching the recogniser at all (permission, device, or capture); a moving meter with no command means the audio is arriving but is not being recognised (gain too low for the AGC, or the phrase not said as written).
- Verify the model extracted successfully -- check the `OnModelReady` event or `IsModelReady` property.
- Check logcat: `adb logcat -s "vosk-bridge:*" "Unity:*"`
- Ensure `RECORD_AUDIO` permission is granted.
- Quest 3 microphone gain is low by default. The AGC compensates, but verify `micGainTargetDb` is set (default `-18` dB).

### No transcription output in Editor

- Run the [Voice Check sample](../Samples~/VoiceCheck/README.md) first -- it tells the two failures apart. A flat meter means no audio is reaching the recogniser at all (permission, device, or capture); a moving meter with no command means the audio is arriving but is not being recognised (gain too low for the AGC, or the phrase not said as written).
- Check the Console for VOSK model loading errors.
- Verify a microphone is connected and set as the default Windows input device.
- On macOS or Linux, the live mic backend is not available -- use the [Text Injection API](editor-testing.md#text-injection-api) instead.

### Commands not matching

- Verify patterns, slot values, and alias keys are **lowercase** and punctuation-free. VOSK outputs lowercase text and strips punctuation.
- Check that grammar mode is active (`freeSpeechMode = false`).
- Lower `minScore` and `minConfidence` temporarily to see if matches are being filtered by thresholds.
- Use `OnUnrecognisedSpeech` to log raw transcripts and compare against your patterns.
- **Check whether the transcript is missing the pattern's *first* required element.** If it is, the round's winner was [barred](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar) and no threshold reaches it — see [A command reports nothing at all](#a-command-reports-nothing-at-all-though-it-clearly-part-matched).
- Open the [Command Debug Window](editor-testing.md#command-debug-window) to see the match breakdown: for each extraction round the parser ran, the pattern that **won** selection, its score and confidence against the thresholds, and why it was accepted or rejected. A round whose winner was [barred](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar) for missing its first required element is shown too, as `Rejected: barred` with no slots -- and as `<intent>: barred` in the window's match history. Losing candidates are not shown, so on the ordinary parse path a pattern's absence means it lost selection, not that it was never tried. One case is not that path: an utterance that resolved a pending command -- a confirm or cancel word, an answer to a disambiguation prompt, or a follow-up slot-fill -- publishes a single synthetic entry for the whole utterance instead of one per round, so nothing it parsed is listed and no absence there tells you anything.
- For a pattern across a whole playtest rather than one utterance, read the [session debug log](editor-testing.md#session-debug-log) written to `Library/VoxrDebugLogs/` when Play Mode ends -- it records every match attempt of the session, so repeated near-threshold rejections are easy to spot.
- To interpret the numbers in either view -- what produced a given `score`, why that pattern won, which gate stopped it -- see [Matching and Scoring](scoring.md), whose [worked examples](scoring.md#7-worked-examples) trace three common outcomes end to end.

### A command fires but a slot value is missing

The utterance had the slot value in it, the command fired, and `GetSlot` returns `""`. The cause is a **bare pattern out-ranking the slot-filled one** after a required function word was dropped. [Coverage](command-recognition.md#coverage) closes the common case -- the bare pattern is charged for the words it leaves unexplained, so the slot-filled form wins and the argument survives -- but it does not close all of it.

If you still see this, in this order:

- **Check whether the stranded value's first word begins another pattern.** The orphan run stops at the first token that could start a match, so the bare form is charged nothing and wins exactly as it did before. With `["hard", "stop"]` registered, "decelerate hard burn" fires bare `decelerate` at `1.00` again -- at the default `coverageWeight`. This is the residue coverage cannot reach.
- **Mark the droppable literal optional** (`"?by"` rather than `"by"`). This is the real fix: it reaches `1.00` rather than `0.67`, so it wins by more, and it wins in the residual case above where coverage alone does not. The parser warns about the shape at construction, naming the literal and the slot at risk -- and that warning was deliberately *not* narrowed when coverage shipped, for exactly this reason. It is logged in the **Editor only**, so check the Console rather than a device log.
- **Check `coverageWeight` is not `0`.** Zeroing it turns coverage off entirely -- back to pre-#31 scoring, before skipped words cost anything -- and brings this bug with it.
- Full explanation, both costs of the swap, and the score arithmetic: [Never leave a required function word between a bare pattern and its slot](command-recognition.md#never-leave-a-required-function-word-between-a-bare-pattern-and-its-slot) and [worked example B](scoring.md#b-coverage-picks-the-pattern-that-explains-more).

### A command stopped firing after upgrading

It worked before, the transcript looks right, and the score in the log is lower than the pattern's own arithmetic predicts. This is [coverage](scoring.md#2-coverage): a command is now scored on how much of the utterance it accounts for, so a short pattern trailed by words the grammar cannot place is demoted -- "decelerate hard burn" against a lone `decelerate` pattern falls from `1.0` to `1 / (1 + 2)` = `0.33`, and "cease fire please" from `1.0` to `0.67`.

Work out `matched / elements` for the winning pattern. If the reported `score` is lower, the difference is the tokens outside the match.

**If the attempt naming that pattern is flagged `barred`, this is not coverage.** A round whose winner missed its *first required element* is [barred](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar): the attempt records the score the candidate reached, but that score is not what refused it. The refusal is positional — `minScore`, `coverageWeight` and a longer pattern all leave it untouched. And if the log holds no attempt naming the pattern at all, it is neither coverage nor the bar: on the ordinary parse path the pattern lost selection to something else. Check first that the utterance took that path -- one that resolved a pending command publishes a single synthetic entry for the whole parse, naming no pattern at all, and there the absence is a property of the path rather than a verdict on your grammar. See [A command reports nothing at all, though it clearly part-matched](#a-command-reports-nothing-at-all-though-it-clearly-part-matched).

- **If you had tuned `coverageWeight` down, check the value survived the upgrade.** It was named `skippedWordPenalty` before #65. The component's own value migrates, but a prefab-*instance* override of the old name may not -- and a lost override silently restores the `1.0` default, which produces exactly this symptom.
- Register the fuller phrasing as an additional pattern, so the demotion has somewhere to land. This is the intended response.
- Bring natural trailing words into the grammar as optional literals (`?please`, `?now`).
- Blunter: lower `minScore`, or set `coverageWeight` below `1.0`. Setting it to `0` turns coverage off entirely -- back to pre-#31 scoring, and the discarded-argument bug above comes with it. **The two knobs have different lifetimes**, which matters if you are tuning live: `minScore` is read fresh on every parse, so an Inspector edit applies to the very next utterance. `coverageWeight` is captured when the parser is built, and nothing watches the field -- so a Play Mode edit does nothing until you call `RebuildParser()` (or `Configure`, `SetActiveSets`, `NotifySlotChanged`), or re-enter Play Mode. Drag it mid-session and you will wrongly conclude coverage was not the cause.
- Measured cases and the shapes with no user-level workaround: [Known Limitations](../KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md), plus worked example [B2](scoring.md#b2-the-same-demotion-with-nowhere-to-land).

### A command scores ~0.50 and is rejected

A score near `0.50` with slots that *did* extract is the signature of exactly one dropped required literal on a **two-element** pattern -- `(0 + 1) / 2`. Two elements is the floor: half the evidence is genuinely ambiguous (`cease fire` heard as "fire" is a different command where `fire` is registered), so it stays rejected by design.

**Check which element went missing before reaching for a threshold.** If it was the pattern's *first required* one -- as in the `cease fire` example above -- the score is not what refused the command: it is [barred](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar), and no value of `minScore` reaches it.

**On three or more elements this no longer happens -- provided the dropped word was not the pattern's first required element.** One dropped required literal costs `1/N`, so a three-element pattern scores `2/3` = `0.67` and fires; the same drop on a seven-element pattern scores `6/7` = `0.86`. If you are seeing `~0.50` on a longer pattern, more than one element missed.

Lowering `minScore` is still the wrong fix (it lets genuinely partial matches through everywhere else). What to do instead depends on **which** element went missing:

- **A non-leading element** -- lengthen the pattern, or accept the ambiguity. Lengthening genuinely works here: it raises the score of the surviving evidence, and a three-element pattern already clears the gate.
- **The first required element** -- neither lengthening nor any threshold recovers it, because the refusal is positional. The command must be said again. To stop it recurring, change the grammar: give the intent a phrasing that reaches the words your speakers actually produce ([A bare pattern's tail can be read as another command](command-recognition.md#do-not-leave-a-bare-patterns-tail-readable-as-another-command)).

See [Short patterns are disproportionately fragile](scoring.md#short-patterns-are-disproportionately-fragile) and [the bar](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar).

### The wrong command fires, consistently, and its score looks healthy

Two *different* intents whose patterns differ at exactly one required word cannot be told apart once the recogniser drops it. `switch to weapons` and `switch to navigation` both reduce to `switch to`, both score `(1 + 1 + 0) / 3` = `0.67`, and both consume the same span with the same literal count — so selection runs out of keys and falls through to its last, **registration order**. Whichever was declared first fires, every time, however clearly the speaker said the other.

The healthy-looking score is the tell: nothing went wrong with the match. The word that would have decided is the word that went missing, so no threshold or penalty reaches this.

**Check the Editor console at construction.** The parser warns about this shape by name, listing the intents, the patterns as you wrote them, and the element they differ at. Three cases it deliberately stays quiet about: patterns of the *same* intent (the same command dispatches either way); pairs too short for the tie to clear your `minScore` — at the default `0.6` a two-element pair scores `0.5`, and *both* siblings are rejected, so you get silence rather than a wrong command; and pairs whose differing word is **every** pattern's *first required element*, where dropping it bars whichever candidate wins the round, so that round yields nothing — no command fires and no question is asked. The second of those is judged against the threshold you configured on the recogniser, not against the default, so lowering `minScore` to `0.4` brings that two-element pair *into* the warning's reach rather than hiding it from it — change the value in the Inspector and the scan picks it up the next time the parser is rebuilt. The third reads no threshold at all — it is positional — so it stays correct however you set `minScore`, and it takes **every** competing pattern: where the differing word leads only *some* of them, the tie is live and is warned about.

**The eager-flush gate no longer commits early on this shape.** Where the buffer fits two different intents exactly equally and they differ at one required word, it declines and waits out the full window instead of firing a coin flip mid-utterance. That covers the **middle**-of-pattern case the gate's tail rule cannot see — `set {ship} mode on` against `set {ship} level on`, heard as "set alpha on". The same command still fires, at the end of the window rather than immediately, so the wrong-command symptom above is unchanged; only its timing is.

**The fix that actually resolves it: turn on `disambiguateSiblingTies`.** The gate above buys the decision one thing — it happens once, at the flush, on a final transcript — and that is where the recogniser can *ask*. (That gate needs `eagerFlushOnCompleteMatch`, which is off by default; the flag does not, and works either way.) With the flag on, an ambiguous utterance fires nothing, raises `OnCommandPending` with `PendingAmbiguity` set, and the speaker says the one distinguishing word (`weapons`, `navigation`) to settle it. It is off by default because it needs somewhere to put the question: with no `OnCommandPending` subscriber the command is lost rather than merely mis-picked. See [Ask instead of guessing](command-recognition.md#ambiguous-commands-ask-instead-of-guessing).

Where you cannot prompt, the grammar-side fixes still apply: diverge by more than one word; make the differing word each pattern's *first* required element, so a dropped discriminator bars the winner and nothing fires instead of the wrong thing (which also, correctly, stops the construction-time warning reporting that pair); or give the more destructive of the pair `requiresConfirmation`. Where both phrasings must exist verbatim, register the safer one first. See [Do not separate two commands by a single word](command-recognition.md#do-not-separate-two-commands-by-a-single-word).

### A command reports nothing at all, though it clearly part-matched

Distinct from a score rejection: nothing was gated. **Two different rules produce this, and they are told apart by *which* elements missed, not how many** -- and the session log settles it outright, because one of them leaves an attempt behind and the other leaves none.

**A count -- the candidate never became one.** A pattern that **missed more of its required elements than it matched** is refused admission before selection, whatever it would have scored, so a very sparse partial match produces no result rather than a low-scoring one. Count the pattern's required elements against how many the transcript actually supplied; optional elements count toward neither side. See [Admission](scoring.md#admission-what-counts-as-a-candidate-at-all).

**A position -- the candidate won and was barred.** If the pattern's **first required element** matched nothing, the candidate did become one: it competed, won its round, and consumed the tokens it matched. It was then [barred from firing](scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar), and the round writes an attempt flagged `barred` -- `accepted: false`, a `rejectReason` of `barred`, an empty `slots` array, and the score the candidate reached. **Counting matched against missed elements will not find this**, because the count can be perfectly healthy: `cease fire now` heard as "fire now" matches two of three and scores `0.67`. Look at *which* element is missing, and check whether it is the first one the pattern requires.

The two are easy to tell apart once you know to ask, and in the log they tell themselves apart: a barred round leaves a `barred` attempt naming the pattern, while a match refused admission leaves no attempt at all. A sparse match that failed admission looks wrong; a barred round looks healthy on every number it reports, except that its command did not fire.

### Commands match but with wrong slot values

This typically occurs when VOSK mishears a word due to phonetic similarity. For example, "to" may be transcribed as "two", or "all" as "fall" when a phonetically similar word is prominent in the grammar.

- Check the raw transcript (via `OnUnrecognisedSpeech` or the Command Debug Window) to see what VOSK actually heard.
- Try grammar mode if you are in free speech mode -- constrained grammar greatly reduces homophone confusion.
- Add slot value aliases for common mishearings (e.g. `"a"` -> `"one"`).
- See [Known Limitations](../KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the full list of documented homophone issues with the small English model.

### Confidence shows -1.00

A confidence value of `-1.00` means **"no word data available"**, not "zero confidence." It occurs when VOSK provided no per-word confidence for the matched span -- most often because the utterance carried none at all (injected text), and occasionally because a buffered utterance matched on a segment that carried none. Commands with `-1` confidence bypass the `minConfidence` threshold and are accepted or rejected on pattern-match score alone. See [Matching and Scoring](scoring.md#minconfidence-default-04).

If you display confidence in a debug UI, treat `-1.00` as "n/a" rather than as a numeric value.

### Commands split across two results

VOSK's voice activity detector treats pauses as utterance boundaries and flushes an interim result. If the user pauses mid-command (e.g. "launch missiles" *pause* "target hotel one"), VOSK produces two separate transcripts and neither matches a complete pattern on its own.

The utterance buffer (`bufferWindow`) is designed for this case -- it merges consecutive results before parsing. The default is `0.5` (tuned for typical PC latency). On Quest 3, VOSK latency adds ~0.5--1.0s to inter-result gaps, so the 0.5s default is usually too short.

- Set `bufferWindow = 2.0` for Quest 3 builds.
- Do not exceed ~2.5--3.0s or unrelated utterances may merge ("cross-command bleed").
- Encourage users to speak commands in one breath, or use push-to-talk to scope each recognition burst.

### "Native bridge library (libvosk-bridge) not found"

The native libraries are Android arm64 only. In the Editor, recognition routes through `EditorMicBackend` instead (Windows only). On macOS/Linux Editor, only text injection is available.

### False matches from noise or coughs

In grammar mode, VOSK must produce an in-vocabulary word for any audio input -- it has no "silence" output. Short noises can map to short grammar words like "on", "from", or "four".

- Use [push-to-talk](push-to-talk.md) to gate recognition to intentional speech.
- Increase `minConfidence` slightly -- noise-derived matches usually have confidence well below 0.5. Don't push it past ~0.5 or NumberSequence commands containing "two" will be rejected.
- Prefer longer, multi-token commands -- false triggers rarely produce more than one in-grammar word in a row.

### Set switching drops the first words of the next command

`SetActiveSets()` causes a ~50ms audio gap during grammar rebuild. Speech during this window is lost at the audio layer.

- Pause ~500ms after a mode switch before speaking the next command.
- Provide visual or audio feedback when the switch completes.
- See [Command Sets](command-sets.md) for the full explanation and the single-set gating alternative.
