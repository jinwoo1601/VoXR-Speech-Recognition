# Data Types

Result and command data structures returned by the recognition pipeline.

## VoxrResult

`public readonly struct VoxrResult` -- Namespace: `VoXR`

The full recognition result with word-level data.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Text` | `string` | The full recognised text |
| `Words` | `VoxrWord[]` | Per-word confidence and timing for the best hypothesis (empty if unavailable) |

**Constructor** -- `public VoxrResult(string text, VoxrWord[] words)`

## VoxrWord

`public readonly struct VoxrWord` -- Namespace: `VoXR`

A single recognised word with metadata.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Text` | `string` | The recognised word |
| `Confidence` | `float` | Confidence score in range [0, 1] |
| `StartTime` | `float` | Start time in seconds from beginning of utterance |
| `EndTime` | `float` | End time in seconds from beginning of utterance |

**Constructor** -- `public VoxrWord(string text, float confidence, float startTime, float endTime)`

**`ToString()`** -- `"{Text} ({Confidence:F2})"`, e.g. `orient (0.91)`.

## VoxrCommand

`public readonly struct VoxrCommand` -- Namespace: `VoXR.Commands`

A parsed command with intent and extracted slots.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Intent` | `string` | The matched command intent (e.g. `"launch_weapon"`) |
| `Slots` | `VoxrSlotMatch[]` | Matched slot name/value pairs |
| `Confidence` | `float` | Minimum word confidence across matched tokens, each read at its own position in the transcript. `-1` means no word data was available *for the matched span* — which is not always the same as the utterance carrying none; see [the two gates](../scoring.md#minconfidence-default-04). |
| `Score` | `float` | Pattern match quality (0.0--1.0). Higher is better. |
| `RawText` | `string` | The original VOSK transcript text |
| `MatchedPatternIndex` | `int` | Index into the definition's `Patterns` array identifying which pattern produced this match. `-1` when unavailable. |

**Constructor** -- `public VoxrCommand(string intent, VoxrSlotMatch[] slots, float confidence, float score, string rawText, string[] registeredSlotNames = null, int matchedPatternIndex = -1)`. The two optional parameters change behaviour: `registeredSlotNames` is the list `GetSlot` checks a name against, so leaving it `null` disables the typo warning entirely, and `matchedPatternIndex` defaults to `-1` (unavailable). A `null` `slots` becomes an empty array.

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `GetSlot(string name)` | Returns the value of a named slot, or empty string if not matched. In a `DEBUG` build, logs a warning if the slot name was not registered -- but only when the command carries a registered-slot-name list, so a command rebuilt by follow-up slot fill never warns. For a `NumberSequence` slot the value is the number words as spoken — `"two seven zero"`, not `"270"` (see below); for an `Enumerated` slot it is the canonical value, with any spoken alias already resolved. |
| `HasSlot(string name)` | Returns true if the named slot was matched in this command. |
| `ToString()` | `"{Intent} ({Slots.Length} slots, score={Score:F2})"`, e.g. `orient_heading (1 slots, score=0.92)`. |

> **NumberSequence slots return spoken words, not digits.** `int.TryParse` on the returned value fails on every utterance and yields `0` without throwing. Convert with [`VoxrNumberParser`](number-parser.md) — `ParseDigitSequence` for digit-by-digit values, `ParseCardinal` for cardinal phrases. The canonical fallback snippet is in [Command Recognition → NumberSequence Slots](../command-recognition.md#numbersequence-slots).

## VoxrSlotMatch

`public readonly struct VoxrSlotMatch` -- Namespace: `VoXR.Commands`

A single slot extraction result.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Name` | `string` | Slot name (e.g. `"weapon"`) |
| `Value` | `string` | Matched value. For an `Enumerated` slot this is the canonical value (e.g. `"missiles"`), with any spoken alias already resolved (`"jackals"` → `"jackal"`). For a `NumberSequence` slot it is the number words as spoken (`"two seven zero"`), not a numeric string — convert with [`VoxrNumberParser`](number-parser.md). |

**Constructor** -- `public VoxrSlotMatch(string name, string value)`

**`ToString()`** -- `"{Name}={Value}"`, e.g. `weapon=missiles`.

## VoxrCommandResult

`public readonly struct VoxrCommandResult` -- Namespace: `VoXR.Commands`

Parser output wrapping match/no-match.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `IsMatch` | `bool` | True if a command pattern matched |
| `Command` | `VoxrCommand` | The parsed command (only valid when `IsMatch` is true) |
| `RawText` | `string` | The original VOSK transcript |

**Constructors** -- `public VoxrCommandResult(VoxrCommand command)` sets `IsMatch` true and takes `RawText` from the command; `public VoxrCommandResult(string rawText)` sets `IsMatch` false and leaves `Command` at its default.

## VoxrListeningMode

`public enum VoxrListeningMode` -- Namespace: `VoXR`

How `VoxrPushToTalkController` gates the speech recogniser. Read and written at runtime through its `ListeningMode` property, and set initially in the Inspector.

| Value | Int | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| `Continuous` | 0 | Recognition runs whenever the controller is enabled; `PressTalk()` and `ReleaseTalk()` become no-ops. |
| `PushToTalk` | 1 | Recognition only runs between `PressTalk()` and `ReleaseTalk()`. The controller's default. |

See [Push-to-Talk → Listening Modes](../push-to-talk.md#listening-modes) for the setter semantics of switching mode at runtime.

## VoxrPendingTimeoutBehavior

`public enum VoxrPendingTimeoutBehavior` -- Namespace: `VoXR.Commands`

Determines what happens when a pending command's timeout expires.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Cancel` | The pending command is cancelled and discarded. `OnCommandCancelled` fires. |
| `FireAsIs` | The pending command fires as-is with whatever slots were filled. `OnCommandConfirmed`, `OnCommandRecognised`, and `OnCommandsRecognised` (as a single-element batch) fire, and the intent's debounce window is recorded. |

`FireAsIs` is one of the two [deliberate exceptions](../command-recognition.md#the-two-ways-an-incomplete-command-still-fires) to the rule that a command missing a required argument does not fire — but only for commands whose definition sets `allowPartialMatch`. A pending that is merely awaiting confirmation always holds a complete command, so `FireAsIs` on its own never fires an incomplete one. Where both apply, the handler must tolerate every required slot being absent.

**`FireAsIs` does not apply to a pending disambiguation.** There the *intent* is unknown, not the arguments — `FireAsIs` means "the command is known, fire it with what I have", which is a different situation wearing the same flag. Firing the first-registered candidate after a pause would be the same coin flip the question was asked to avoid, merely later. An unanswered ambiguity cancels under either setting.

## VoxrPendingAmbiguity

`public readonly struct VoxrPendingAmbiguity` -- Namespace: `VoXR.Commands`

What the recogniser is asking about when a pending command is a sibling-tie disambiguation rather than a confirmation. Read it from `VoxrCommandRecogniser.PendingAmbiguity` inside an `OnCommandPending` handler. Only ever non-null with [`disambiguateSiblingTies`](command-recogniser.md#inspector-fields) enabled.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Choices` | `VoxrCommand[]` | The commands the recogniser could not tell apart. `Choices[i]` is what fires if the speaker says `DiscriminatingValues[i]`. Index 0 is the candidate that would have fired with the flag off; beyond that the order is registration order and stable across runs |
| `DiscriminatingValues` | `string[]` | The one word that tells each choice apart — what the speaker says to pick it. Already in the decoder's grammar, because these are pattern literals |
| `IsTruncated` | `bool` | An answer the speaker could have given is **not** on this list, so `Choices` is not the whole set of things they might have meant. Worth wording into the prompt — "…or say the whole command again" — because re-uttering is the only way to reach what is missing |

### Reading it

`HasValue` is the reason signal, and checking it is not optional. `OnCommandPending` carries only a `VoxrCommand`, so an integrator already subscribed for `requiresConfirmation` will otherwise prompt "yes/no" at a speaker who needs to say a *word* — and "yes" does nothing under a disambiguation, so the pending sits until it times out and then fires nothing.

```csharp
recogniser.OnCommandPending += cmd =>
{
    var ambiguity = recogniser.PendingAmbiguity;
    if (ambiguity.HasValue)
    {
        // "Did you mean mode or level?"  — the speaker answers with one word.
        Prompt("Did you mean " + string.Join(" or ", ambiguity.Value.DiscriminatingValues)
               + (ambiguity.Value.IsTruncated ? ", or say the whole command again?" : "?"));
    }
    else
    {
        Prompt("Confirm " + cmd.Intent + "?");   // yes / no
    }
};
```

The arrays are allocated once when the pending is entered and are safe to retain, but they are the live pending's own arrays rather than copies — **do not write to them**, as that would change which word resolves the question and what fires when it does.

Answering is ordinary follow-up speech. The value is matched as a *whole* utterance, so "set alpha mode on" is a re-utterance that preempts the question rather than an answer to it. Cancel vocabulary keeps its precedence, so a discriminating value that is also a cancel word cancels instead of choosing — the grammar author is warned about that collision at construction.
