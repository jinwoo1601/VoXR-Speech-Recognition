            + "the matched span came from a segment that carried none. Slot startWord/endWord "
            + "are half-open [startWord, endWord) indices into the whitespace-split inputText, "
            + "not into the words array; they stay valid even when words is empty. "

            + "gave no reason, so an empty resolvedReason does NOT mean the slot was spoken. A "
            + "resolved slot also carries startWord, endWord and confidence of -1, since no words "
            + "were said — corroborating, not the discriminator. On the follow-up slot-fill "
            + "attempt described above, slots lists the resolved slots ONLY: that attempt has no "
            + "parse round behind it, so the spoken slots of the command it completes are not "

            + "'intent (pattern N)'; it is empty when nothing tied it, so a coin-flip win is "
            + "distinguishable from a clean one. tiedRivalIsSibling is true when that rival was "

            + "against this attempt's intent. A differing intent is a grammar defect — duplicate "
            + "or overlapping patterns, one of which can never fire. The SAME intent is the "
            + "winner's own second phrasing tying it, which is harmless and routine. "
            + "tiedRivalIsSibling is meaningless when tiedRival is empty. runnerUpIntent and "

            + "had the winner not been there — ranked by the same order selection itself used: "
            + "earliest start, then score, then consumed span, then literal count. They are "
            + "empty and -1 when the round had a single candidate. This is NOT the same field "
            + "as tiedRival: a runner-up is recorded however far behind it finished, while "
            + "tiedRival is set only on an exact tie, and the two coincide exactly when the "

            + "earliest start outranks score, a runner-up can carry a HIGHER score than the "
            + "winner; that is the selection order working, not a defect. Note the "
