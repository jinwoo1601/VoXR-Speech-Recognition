# Known Limitations

This document collects known limitations of the VoXR that aren't
bugs to fix but rather constraints rooted in the underlying VOSK acoustic model,
voice recognition in general, or deliberate architectural choices. The goal is
to give consumers (and our future selves) a single place to look when something
"weird" happens, before assuming it's a regression.

Each entry includes a short repro, the root cause, and a workaround (if any).

## VOSK Acoustic Model

Limitations rooted in the small English VOSK model
(`vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`) the README directs you to install. Switching
to a larger model would mitigate some of these but at the cost of memory and
download size.

### "to" misrecognised as "two"

- **Status**: still open. One TTS fixture stopped reproducing it after
  phrase-chunked grammar emission
  ([#45](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/45)):
  `switch to navigation` is now a single grammar entry, that fixture decodes
  correctly and fires `mode_navigation`, and it has been re-baselined from a
  negative pin to a positive one. That is the whole of the evidence — one
  synthesised-speech fixture. The limitation was originally observed in **human
  speech on device**, and has **not** been re-tested there since; the in-headset
  A/B against this and the other documented confusion pairs has not been run.
  Treat #45 as a plausible mitigation, not a fix.
- **Repro**: Say "switch to weapons". VOSK transcribes `switch two weapons`.
  Observed in human speech on Quest (v2.5 test matrix Phase 4.5); not re-tested
  since #45. The TTS fixture for the same phrase has always been recognised
  correctly, and before #45 the "switch to navigation" fixture was transcribed
  `switch two navigation` and matched no command — so the substitution is phrase-
  and delivery-dependent, not uniform.
- **Where seen**: v2.5 test matrix Phase 4.5; WAV-replay acoustic suite (v1.5 dev).
- **Root cause**: The small English model is acoustically biased toward "two"
  in this context, especially when the speaker emphasises the vowel slightly
  or says it quickly. The grammar token splitter is correct — it produces
  `["switch", "to", "weapons"]` — but VOSK never feeds it the right phonemes
  to match.
- **Workaround**:
  - Prefer alternate patterns that avoid short function words. The sample's
    `mode_weapons` command uses both `["switch", "to", "weapons"]` and
    `["weapons", "mode"]`; the latter recognises reliably.
  - When designing your own commands, avoid `to`, `for`, `four`, `or`, `are`
    and similar short homophones inside required tokens — and where you must
    use one, prefer keeping it inside a run of required literals rather than
    adjacent to a slot boundary, so that phrase chunking has a chance to help.
    A slot or optional literal ends a run, so a function word stranded beside
    one gets no phrase entry spanning it at all.

### "all" misrecognised as "fall" when navigation words dominate grammar

- **Repro**: While the `navigation` set is active (contains the
  `fall back from target {target}` pattern), say "all modes". VOSK frequently
  transcribes `fall modes`, and the command fails to match.
- **Where seen**: v2.4 test matrix Phase 4.5 — took 3+ attempts to trigger
  `mode_all` from navigation mode. Documented in v2.4 Known Bugs.
- **Root cause**: When a phonetically similar word ("fall") is prominent in
  the active grammar, VOSK's constrained decoder prefers it over less frequent
  words ("all"). This is a general property of grammar-mode decoding: words
  that appear in more patterns are effectively weighted higher.
- **Workaround**:
  - The sample's `mode_all` command uses both `all modes` and `enable all`.
    `enable all` is the reliable trigger when navigation words are active.
  - For your own commands, offer a phonetically distinct alias for any short
    keyword that clashes with another grammar word.

### "cease fire" misrecognised as "safe five" when weapons set inactive

- **Repro**: Switch to navigation-only mode, then say "cease fire". VOSK
  transcribes `safe five` (or similar) because "cease" and "fire" are no
  longer in the active grammar.
- **Where seen**: v2.4 test matrix Phases 3.5, 4.4 (notes).
- **Root cause**: Same constrained-decoder behaviour as the "all"/"fall"
  issue. With "cease" and "fire" removed from the grammar, VOSK maps the
  phonemes to the nearest in-grammar words. This is actually *working as
  intended* for set restriction — the command is correctly rejected — but it
  means you cannot rely on the raw transcript to explain why recognition
  failed when the user is in the "wrong" mode.
- **Workaround**: None needed for correctness. If you surface raw transcripts
  for debugging, expect surprising substitutions when the user speaks out of
  the active grammar.

### Abbreviations and letter sequences map to [unk]

- **Repro**: Say "close distance cqb target alpha three". VOSK produces
  `close distance [unk] target alpha three`; the `range=cqb` slot fails.
- **Where seen**: v2.0 test matrix Phase 3.2. The shipped sample grammar
  contains **two** such words, not one: `cqb` and `railgun` (measured against
  `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`). Every other word in that grammar is in the
  model — including `pdc`, which reads like an abbreviation but is present.
- **Detection**: In the Windows Editor, each grammar word apart from the
  package's own `[unk]` token is looked up in the loaded model as the grammar
  is applied, and a word the model does not know logs a
  `[VoxrGrammarVocabulary]` Console warning naming it, instead of failing
  silently at recognition time. The warning is advisory — the grammar is
  applied unchanged.
- **Root cause**: The small English model has no entries for some military/radio
  abbreviations and coinages. Grammar mode forces VOSK to choose something
  in-vocabulary, so those words become `[unk]`.
- **Workaround**:
  - Spell out the phrase in the slot value (e.g. `close quarters` instead of
    `cqb`).
  - Alternatively, add phonetic aliases (`see queue bee` → `cqb`) so VOSK can
    match the phoneme sequence.

### Single-character literals ("a") unreliable

- **Repro**: Say "launch a missiles target hotel one" against a pattern of your
  own carrying `?a` as an optional literal (the shipped sample avoids this shape —
  it routes "a" through the alias below instead). VOSK transcribes "a" as "on" or
  drops it entirely.
- **Where seen**: v2.1 test matrix Phase 3.1 (and Phases 3.3–3.4, 6A.2 where
  VOSK silently dropped "a").
- **Root cause**: Very short function words carry almost no acoustic
  information. In grammar mode, any phonetically similar word that exists in
  the active grammar ("on" from `close on target`) outcompetes "a".
- **Workaround**:
  - Don't use single-character literals or single-character alias keys inside
    patterns. The parser now emits a validation warning for single-character
    slot values and alias keys.
  - If you need quantity "a" (as in "fire a torpedo"), declare it as an alias
    to a longer canonical value (`a` → `one`). The alias resolves correctly
    when VOSK *does* hear it (see v2.1 Phase 4.2), and is harmless when
    dropped.

### "two" consistently scores low confidence

- **Repro**: Say any number-sequence command containing "two" (e.g.
  "orient heading two seven zero"). The per-word confidence for "two" is
  almost always 0.50 regardless of grammar size or pronunciation clarity.
- **Where seen**: v2.4 test matrix Phase 9 notes, v2.2 Phase 10.1.
- **Root cause**: Quirk of the small English model — "two" shares phonemes
  with "to"/"too" and the acoustic posterior for this phoneme cluster is flat.
  The grammar constraint only narrows the candidate list; it doesn't sharpen
  the posterior.
- **Workaround**: None. If you set `minConfidence` too strictly, NumberSequence
  commands containing "two" will be rejected. The default `minConfidence=0.4`
  accommodates this; don't push it above 0.5 unless you've verified your
  vocabulary avoids "two".

### Free speech mode is unreliable for numeric and literal commands

- **Repro**: Set `freeSpeechMode=true`, rebuild, say "orient heading two seven
  zero". VOSK transcribes `korean heading to seven zero` ("orient" → "korean",
  "two" → "to" homophone). Pattern fails to match.
- **Where seen**: v2.2 test matrix Phase 10.1 (FAIL), Phase 10.4 notes; v2.0
  Phase 6.2 (PARTIAL — "launch" heard as "lunch or").
- **Root cause**: Without grammar constraint, VOSK's small model has a much
  larger candidate vocabulary and commits to phonetically plausible but
  wrong transcriptions. Homophones ("to"/"two", "four"/"for") and uncommon
  words ("orient") are the first to break.
- **Workaround**:
  - Keep `freeSpeechMode=false` (the default) for command-driven UX.
  - Only enable free speech when you *need* arbitrary dictation (e.g. a
    note-taking feature) and accept that command matching will be best-effort.

## Voice Recognition (General)

Limitations inherent to streaming speech recognition, independent of which
model you use.

### Cough, hum, and noise can trigger false matches in grammar mode

- **Repro**: Cough, hum, or tap the microphone while recognition is active.
  VOSK occasionally transcribes the noise as a short in-grammar word ("on",
  "from", "four"), which may match a pattern prefix.
- **Where seen**: v2.0 test matrix Phase 5.2 (PARTIAL — deferred to voice
  activation); v2.1 Phase 5A.2 (cough heard as "on", "from").
- **Root cause**: Grammar-constrained VOSK *must* choose an in-vocabulary
  word; it has no "silence" output. Short noises that have any voicing will
  be mapped to whichever grammar word their phoneme vector is closest to.
  Since short words ("on", "to", "four") sit closest to low-energy noise in
  phoneme space, they are the most frequent false triggers.
- **Workaround**:
  - Gate recognition with a push-to-talk button: call
    `VoxrSpeechRecogniser.StopRecognition()` / `StartRecognition()` around
    the button press so the parser only looks at intentional speech. This
    is the recommended approach for noisy environments.
  - Tune `minConfidence` upward — noise-derived matches usually have
    confidence well below 0.5. Don't push it past ~0.5 or you will reject
    NumberSequence commands (see "'two' consistently scores low" above).
  - Prefer longer, multi-token commands; false triggers rarely produce
    more than one in-grammar word in a row.

### VOSK's VAD splits mid-command pauses into separate utterances

- **Repro**: Say "orient heading" *pause ~0.8s* "two seven zero". VOSK
  emits two independent final results; neither matches a pattern alone
  ("orient heading" is missing the digit slot, "two seven zero" is missing
  the command prefix).
- **Where seen**: v2.2 test matrix Phase 9.2 (KNOWN LIMITATION).
- **Root cause**: VOSK's voice activity detector treats pauses as utterance
  boundaries and flushes an interim final. The parser sees two disconnected
  transcripts, not one.
- **Workaround**:
  - `bufferWindow` (default 0.5s) is exactly for this case — it merges
    consecutive VOSK results before parsing. See the *Architecture* section
    below for tuning notes.
  - If the pause is longer than `bufferWindow`, the command is lost.
    Re-prompt the user or widen the window (up to ~2.0s on Quest 3 — see
    below).
  - A cross-utterance buffer that merges arbitrarily distant utterances
    was evaluated and deferred: the false-positive risk from concatenating
    genuinely unrelated speech outweighs the benefit for this edge case.

### Set restriction cannot produce meaningful rejection transcripts

- **Repro**: In weapons-only mode, say "approach target alpha one". The
  recogniser correctly rejects the command, but the logged transcript is
  `[unk] target alpha one`, not `approach target alpha one`.
- **Where seen**: v2.4 test matrix Phases 2.4–2.6, 3.5–3.7, 4.2, 4.4.
- **Root cause**: Grammar is rebuilt to contain only the active sets' words,
  so "approach" is no longer in the vocabulary and maps to `[unk]` at the
  acoustic level. This is *correct behaviour* for set restriction — the
  smaller grammar is the whole point — but you cannot tell the user
  "you said X, but X isn't available in the current mode" because the SDK
  never saw the word "X".
- **Workaround**: If you need "wrong-mode" UX (e.g. a hint that says "you
  asked for a navigation command while in weapons mode"), use the single-set
  + superset grammar approach and do mode gating in your `OnCommand` handler
  rather than via `SetActiveSets()`. See the *Active set switching* entry
  below for the same trade-off.

### Smaller grammars don't always yield measurably higher recognition scores

- **Repro**: Run the same phrase with all three sets active, then with only
  the one set it belongs to. Compare scores and confidences.
- **Where seen**: v2.4 test matrix Phase 9 (all four sub-tests passed but
  showed *no measurable difference*).
- **Root cause**: VOSK's decoder is already very confident on commands built
  from distinctive multi-word phrases. Restricting the grammar further does
  reduce the search space, but if the full grammar was already producing
  `score=1.00` / `conf=1.00`, there is no headroom for the restriction to
  improve. The benefit of set restriction is primarily *rejecting out-of-set
  commands* (which Phases 2, 3, 5 confirmed), not boosting in-set accuracy.
- **Workaround**: None needed. Don't expect confidence gains from set
  switching alone — its value is correctness (blocking wrong-mode commands),
  not accuracy.

---

## Architecture and Design

Limitations that come from how the SDK is structured. Most of these are
deliberate trade-offs rather than oversights.

### Only one `VoxrSpeechRecogniser` can be initialised per process

- **Repro**: Put two `VoxrSpeechRecogniser` components in a scene (two GameObjects,
  or two additively-loaded scenes each carrying one) and call `InitialiseAsync()`
  on both. The second logs an error, reports `IsInitialised == false`, and never
  loads its own model.
- **Root cause**: The native bridge is file-scope C++ state — `g_model`,
  `g_recognizer`, `g_initialised` in `NativeBridge~/src/vosk_bridge.cpp` — and its
  C ABI carries no handle, so on device there is exactly one bridge per process.
  Nothing on the managed side can make two components genuinely independent there
  without changing that ABI.
- **Why it also applies in the Windows Editor, where it need not**: the Editor
  backend (`EditorMicBackend`) is per-instance — it loads its own VOSK model and
  never calls `vosk_bridge_*` — so two recognisers could coexist there, and did
  before #57. The rule is enforced uniformly anyway. The alternative is worse: a
  two-recogniser scene that runs in the Editor and silently corrupts on device is
  harder to diagnose than one that fails identically in both, and the Editor is
  where the developer can still see the error. Enforcing on both branches is also
  what makes the constraint testable at all — the automated coverage this has runs
  in EditMode/PlayMode, not on device.
- **What this used to do**: Before the enforcement landed (#57) the sharing was
  silent. The second component's `InitialiseAsync()` early-returned on the *first*
  one's `IsInitialised` and quietly discarded its own model path, sample rate, and
  AGC target; then either component's `OnDestroy` called the unconditional
  `vosk_bridge_destroy()` and freed the survivor's recognizer and model, which on
  ordinary additive scene unload left the survivor calling into freed memory.
- **Workaround**: Keep one recogniser for the lifetime of the process — a
  persistent GameObject (`DontDestroyOnLoad`) that per-scene code holds a reference
  to, rather than one recogniser per scene. Where a handover is genuinely needed,
  call `ReleaseNativeResources()` on the outgoing recogniser first: that frees the
  claim **synchronously**, so the incoming one initialises in the same frame.
  Destroying it also frees the claim, but only via `OnDestroy` — which Unity defers
  to the end of the frame, so `Destroy(outgoing); incoming.Initialise();` in one
  frame is rejected with an error, as is an `UnloadSceneAsync` that overlaps the
  incoming scene's `Start()`. Under the default push-to-talk wiring the next press
  retries and succeeds (losing only the pre-warm); in `Continuous` listening mode
  nothing retries, so the explicit `ReleaseNativeResources()` handover matters there.
- **Note**: Refcounting the bridge, or giving the ABI a per-instance handle so two
  recognisers could genuinely coexist on device, remain open as native-side work —
  unfiled; this entry is their only record. What ships today makes the constraint
  explicit and loud instead of silently corrupting state.

### Active set switching has a brief audio gap

- **Repro**: Trigger a `SetActiveSets()` call (e.g. via a `mode_*` command),
  then immediately try to speak the next command. The first one or two words
  of the second utterance are dropped.
- **Where seen**: v2.5 test matrix Phase 5.4. After saying "navigation mode"
  the user said "fall back from target hotel two" too quickly, and VOSK only
  heard `target hotel two` — the leading three words were lost.
- **Root cause**: `SetActiveSets()` calls `RebuildParserAndGrammar()` which
  stops AudioCapture, applies the new grammar to the VOSK recogniser, and
  restarts AudioCapture. The full sequence takes ~50ms minimum on Quest 3,
  during which the microphone isn't being read. Any speech in that window is
  dropped at the audio layer, before VOSK ever sees it.
- **Workaround**:
  - After triggering a mode switch, pause for ~500ms before speaking the next
    command. In a game UI, gate user input by wiring a callback off
    `OnCommandRecognised` for the `mode_*` intents (a visual "Mode: Weapons"
    indicator doubles as the ready signal).
  - If you need seamless switching, prefer the **single-set + grammar
    superset** approach: configure all your commands in one set and gate them
    in your `OnCommand` handler instead of swapping active sets at runtime.

### Validation warnings re-emit on every active-set switch

- **Repro**: Wire any slot with a single-character alias (e.g. `a` → `one`)
  and call `SetActiveSets()` repeatedly. The
  `[VoxrCommandParser] Slot 'quantity' has single-character alias "a"...`
  warning fires on every switch, not just at initial Configure.
- **Where seen**: v2.5 test matrix Phases 5–8. Visible in logcat after every
  mode-switch command.
- **Root cause**: `SetActiveSets()` constructs a fresh `VoxrCommandParser` via
  `RebuildParserAndGrammar()`, and the parser ctor unconditionally re-runs its
  validation passes — `RunValidationWarnings()` for slot values and aliases, and
  `WarnOnExcessiveOptionalExpansion()` for a pattern past the eager-flush
  expansion cap. The warnings are correct, just noisier than they should be.
  Three further scans are Editor-only: the droppable-required-literal check
  (demoted in [#81](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/81) —
  in a player build it no longer contributes), the sibling-discriminator
  warning, which is the loudest of the set, and the duplicate-intent check
  ([#120](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/120)).
  That last one compounds this limitation rather than merely joining it: the
  duplication it reports can be *created* by the switch — two sets that each
  carry a command under the same intent are only in conflict while both are
  active — so it re-reports on every switch that keeps them active together.
  So in the Editor all **five** passes re-run on every switch; a player build
  re-runs only the unconditional two.
- **Workaround**: None at user level. This is a candidate for cleanup —
  validation should run once per `Configure()` call, not per parser rebuild.
  Filed as a low-priority follow-up.

### The model-cache freshness check still costs a main-thread copy on the launches that read the archive

- **Symptom**: On a launch where the model archive is actually read — the first
  launch after an install, and any launch on which the archive's source identity
  moved — the Android path spends about 19 ms on the main thread materialising the
  ~39 MB archive as a managed byte array from `UnityWebRequest`'s
  `downloadHandler.data`, and the managed heap grows by ~43 MB that nothing
  releases until a GC runs. An ordinary cached launch pays neither: it serves the
  cache off a single `stat` and never opens the archive.
- **Repro**: Install a build on Quest and launch it (the model is extracted).
  Reinstall the *same* build, byte for byte, and launch again: the archive is read
  and hashed a second time, although nothing about it changed. Launch a third time
  without reinstalling and it is not read at all.
- **Where seen**: device measurements taken for
  [#153](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/153) on a
  Quest 3 (Horizon OS / Android 14, 90 Hz, Development build, so the timings are
  an upper bound).
- **Root cause**: two independent things.
  - The copy. `downloadHandler.data` hands back a managed array and there is no
    off-main-thread route to it;
    [#154](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/154)
    removed the polling stall around the transfer, not the copy after it. Only the
    SHA-256 itself is reliably on a thread-pool thread.
  - The reinstall. The source-identity token is the container path, byte length
    and last-write-UTC ticks of the *file the archive lives in* — the APK, on an
    ordinary Android build — and an install always replaces that container.
    Device-verified: reinstalling a byte-identical build moves both the path and
    the mtime. A cheaper identity was tried and rejected — `versionCode` reported
    `1` for a freshly rebuilt APK and for a four-month-old build alike, so it
    cannot tell them apart at all.
- **Why this is recorded rather than fixed**: the failure direction is chosen, not
  accidental. The token over-invalidates and never under-invalidates: an identity
  that moves while the bytes did not costs one read and one hash and never a
  re-extraction, while bytes that change cannot fail to move it. A stickier
  identity would buy back the reinstall's hash at the price of the one failure
  this design is not allowed to have — serving a model the archive no longer
  contains.
- **Status of one delivery mode**: **unverified**. `Application.streamingAssetsPath`
  is built by concatenating `jar:file://` with `Application.dataPath`, and the
  container is parsed back out of that string. Where a project ships
  StreamingAssets outside the main APK — Split Application Binary, or Play Asset
  Delivery — it has not been confirmed here whether that path tracks the real
  container; if it does not, a changed archive delivered that way might not move
  the token. This package's model archive is expected to ship inside the APK and
  neither configuration has been tested, so this is recorded as an untested
  configuration rather than as a confirmed hazard.
- **Workaround**:
  - For the reinstall cost, none is needed: it buys one read and one hash, never a
    re-extraction.
  - For the copy, none at user level. It happens inside `InitialiseAsync()`, so
    call that deliberately at load time rather than letting the first push-to-talk
    press trigger it, and the cost lands where a hitch is affordable.
  - If you do ship StreamingAssets outside the APK and a changed model appears not
    to take effect, force a re-extraction: delete the extracted folder under
    `Application.persistentDataPath/VoxrModels/`, or the `.voxr-model-stamp`
    inside it, as `Documentation~/getting-started.md` describes.

### Coverage demotes a command when it explains too little of what was said

- **Repro**: Register only `decelerate` (no slot-filled sibling) and say
  "decelerate hard burn". The command scores `1 / (1 + 2)` = `0.333` against the
  default `minScore` of `0.6` and does not fire; before the coverage change (#65)
  it scored `1.0` and fired. Same shape for any short pattern followed by words the grammar cannot
  place: "cease fire please" drops `1.0` → `0.667`, "approach target alpha one now"
  → `0.750`.
- **Where seen**: measured across a 699-utterance A/B during #65 §5.2. 17 of 699
  stopped clearing the gate; 8 of those were partially-heard utterances that had
  been sitting on exactly `0.600`.
- **Root cause**: coverage charges a candidate for the in-grammar tokens it leaves
  unexplained on either side, so a command is no longer judged on how neatly it
  matched the part it chose but on how much of the utterance it accounts for. That
  is deliberate — it is what stops a bare pattern silently discarding a spoken
  argument (#42) — but it applies whether or not a better sibling exists to win
  instead.
- **Workaround**:
  - Register the fuller phrasing as an additional pattern, so the demotion has
    somewhere to land. This is the intended authoring response.
  - Mark natural trailing words optional (`?please`) to bring them into the
    grammar.
  - Lower `minScore`, or set `coverageWeight` below `1.0`. Setting it to `0`
    switches coverage off on *both* sides, so it reverts further than undoing #65 —
    back to pre-1.4.0 scoring, before the leading skipped-word charge existed —
    and brings the discarded-argument bug back with it. Note the value is read
    when the parser is built, so a change takes effect at the next
    `RebuildParser` / `Configure` / `SetActiveSets` / `NotifySlotChanged`.

### A prefab-instance override of the old `skippedWordPenalty` may not survive the rename (unverified)

- **Symptom**: After upgrading past the `skippedWordPenalty` → `coverageWeight`
  rename (#65), a prefab **instance** that overrode the old field runs at the
  default `coverageWeight` of `1.0` instead of its override. Commands stop firing
  exactly as in the coverage-demotion entry above, which makes the two easy to
  confuse.
- **Root cause**: the renamed field carries `[FormerlySerializedAs]`, which governs
  the field's own deserialization — component values on scene objects, assets, and
  prefab *sources* migrate. A prefab-instance override, though, is stored as a
  literal property-path string in the instance's modification list, and whether
  Unity remaps those paths through the attribute is not established here; no
  automated instrument in this package can settle it.
- **Status**: **unverified** — recorded as an upgrade hazard, not a confirmed
  defect.
- **Workaround**: after upgrading, re-check any prefab instance that overrode
  `skippedWordPenalty` and re-apply the value to the renamed **Coverage Weight**
  field if the override was lost. `Documentation~/troubleshooting.md` carries the
  same check in its post-upgrade entry.

### Batch, injected, and free-speech scores read lower than the live grammar-mode score

- **Repro**: With `freeSpeechMode` enabled, or via `InjectText`, or through
  `VoxrBatchTestRunner.Run`, feed "cease fire please". The score is `0.667`, not
  the `1.0` the same utterance gets through the grammar-constrained decoder.
- **Where seen**: #65 §5.2 review; `requirements.md` §4.1 records the derivation.
- **Root cause**: coverage exempts the literal token `[unk]`, which is what a
  grammar-constrained VOSK returns for a word outside its vocabulary. The three
  paths above deliver real text instead, so a word the decoder would have hidden
  arrives verbatim and is charged as unexplained. The leading half of the rule has
  always behaved this way; #65 newly exposes the trailing half, where filler is
  commoner.
- **Workaround**: treat batch and free-speech scores as a lower bound on the
  grammar-constrained score, not as equal to it.
  `Documentation~/editor-testing.md` states the same caveat in its
  batch-runner Programmatic API section.

### The discarded-argument protection weakens in grammars with slot-initial patterns

- **Repro**: Register any pattern whose first matchable element is a permissive
  slot — an open-ended `NumberSequence`, say. Trailing coverage then goes quiet at
  every token *that slot could match*: for a `NumberSequence`, every position where
  enough digit words follow becomes a run terminator, so digit-heavy trailing
  speech escapes the charge. The effect is scoped to the slot's own vocabulary —
  a value-list slot qualifies only its listed values, and unrelated words are
  charged exactly as before.
- **Where seen**: identified at design time (#65 architecture D4), confirmed by
  the `CanStartPattern` tests.
- **Root cause**: the orphan test is deliberately conservative — where it is
  uncertain whether a pattern could start at a token, it charges nothing, because
  over-charging destroys multi-command utterances while under-charging only leaves
  a score where it was. A permissive slot-initial pattern makes the predicate say
  "yes" wherever that slot could begin a match.
- **Workaround**: none needed for correctness — at those positions the grammar
  reverts to pre-#65 scoring. If the #42 protection matters, avoid slot-initial
  patterns over open-ended slots, or anchor them behind a literal.

### Nothing fires although a better-scoring match exists later in the utterance

- **Repro**: With the demo grammar, say "switch navigation mode" (the "to"
  dropped and a stray "switch" leading). `switch to navigation` matches at token 0
  by skipping the "to", scores `0.500`, and fires nothing; `navigation mode` at
  token 1 would have scored `0.667`.
- **Where seen**: #65 §5.2 review. Swept exhaustively over 699 utterances: 29
  candidates were blocked this way and **28 were recovered** by a later extraction
  round. This is the only one that was not. Re-swept after #82 changed the orphan
  run's terminator: **28 blocked, 27 recovered**, and the same single case still
  silent. Re-swept again after the leading-required-miss bar (#124): **unchanged
  at 28 blocked, 27 recovered**, still this one case. The bar suppresses a round's
  result but leaves the search restarting in the same place, so it cannot change
  where later rounds start — only whether they produce a command. (A barred round
  does not consume a result-buffer slot, so in a grammar small enough for that
  buffer to fill it can let a later round run that would otherwise never have been
  reached; the corpus grammar registers eleven commands, well clear of that bound.)
  It would reduce the recovered count only where a recovering round's own winner
  missed its first required element, which no row of this corpus does.
- **Root cause**: selection ranks earliest start above score, so a later-starting
  candidate cannot be promoted however much better it scores — coverage can only
  reorder candidates that begin at the same token. Normally sequential extraction
  picks the better one up on the next round; it fails only when the winner's
  consumed span covers the start the better candidate needed, as it does here.
- **Workaround**: none at user level. Rare by measurement (1 in 699), and it
  requires the winning pattern to span the alternative's start.

### A command whose first word the decoder dropped is silent rather than recovered

- **Symptom**: A command you said in full produces nothing at all. The transcript
  shows every word except the first one of the pattern, and before this change the
  command fired at a reduced score. Nothing reaches your handlers, but the round is
  on the record: the Editor session log carries an attempt for it flagged `barred`,
  naming the pattern and the score the candidate reached, and the Command Debug
  Window shows the same round as `Rejected: barred`. So this silence is
  distinguishable after the fact from an utterance that genuinely matched nothing —
  in the Editor. A player build records no diagnostics at all, and the runtime
  events are the same either way.
- **Repro**: With the demo grammar, say "heading two seven zero" (the leading "set"
  dropped by the decoder). `set_heading` matches the rest, scores `2 / 3` = `0.667`,
  clears the default `minScore` — and does not fire. Before #124 it fired.
- **Where seen**: issue #124, and the package's own 699-utterance fixture corpus.
  Measured over that corpus, gated at `0.60`: 48 rows change and 17 stop firing
  anything at all — of those 17, **9 lose a genuinely spoken command this way** and
  the other 8 were invented commands the bar exists to suppress (39 invented
  commands are suppressed across all 48 rows). No row loses a command that scored a
  clean `1.00`, and no surviving command's score changes.
- **Root cause**: a round's **winner** whose first required element matched nothing
  is refused, whatever it scored — see
  [the bar](Documentation~/scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar). The rule is
  positional because the first required element is the verb: losing an argument
  leaves the action identified, losing the verb leaves no evidence that any action
  was requested. **Nothing in the transcript distinguishes "the speaker never said
  it" from "the speaker said it and the decoder dropped it"** — both arrive as the
  same token sequence — so the refusal cannot be made selective, and this silence is
  the deliberate price of not firing commands nobody uttered.
- **Workaround**: none at the moment of failure — the speaker says the command
  again. `minScore` and `coverageWeight` do not reach it, and lengthening the pattern
  does not either. What reduces how often it happens is grammar-side: keep a
  pattern's first required element a word the decoder hears reliably (not a short
  unstressed function word), and give the intent an additional phrasing that reaches
  the words your speakers actually produce — see
  [A bare pattern's tail](Documentation~/command-recognition.md#do-not-leave-a-bare-patterns-tail-readable-as-another-command).
- **Note**: the trade is deliberate and was measured before it was taken. The
  alternative — excluding such candidates from selection rather than from firing —
  destroys 11 cleanly spoken commands on the same corpus, because a barred candidate
  winning its round is what absorbs leading debris that would otherwise be charged to
  the next command.

### A candidate barred for its missing first word can still fire as a disambiguation choice

- **Symptom**: With `disambiguateSiblingTies` on, the recogniser asks which of two
  commands you meant, and the one you pick fires although its own first required
  word was never spoken. The same pattern on the same utterance is
  [barred](Documentation~/scoring.md#the-leading-required-miss-bar) and fires
  nothing when it has to win a round on its own — the entry above. The flag is **off by
  default**, and with it off nothing here applies.
- **Repro**: Register `fire_at : ["{ship}", "fire", "at", "{target}", "now"]` and
  `fire_to : ["{?ship}", "fire", "to", "{target}", "now"]`, with slots
  `ship: alpha` and `target: bravo`, turn `disambiguateSiblingTies` on, and feed
  the transcript "alpha bravo now". Both candidates score `3 / 5` = `0.60`,
  clearing the default `minScore`, so the tie is offered as a question — "at" or
  "to".
  Answer "to" and `fire_to` fires, although "fire" was never spoken. Registering
  `fire_at` first is load-bearing, not incidental — see **Root cause**.
- **Where seen**: issue #126, raised against the leading-required-miss bar (#124)
  and ruled *recorded, not gated*. Pinned by three tests in
  `Tests~/Runtime/VoxrCommandRecogniserInjectionTests.cs`.
- **Root cause**: the bar is applied to the round's **winner** only. A tied
  sibling rival is recorded before the bar runs and carries no leading-miss
  information, so it reaches the choice list intact and fires when it is picked.
  Getting there needs a **mixed-anchor** set — one whose members disagree about
  which element is first required — and, just as necessarily, the *unbarred*
  member has to **win** the round. A tie never displaces an incumbent, so
  registration order decides it: register the barred-prone member first and it
  wins, the bar refuses it, and the round yields nothing at all. Here `fire_at` is
  anchored on the required slot `{ship}`, which matched "alpha"; `fire_to`'s
  leading slot is optional, so its own first required element is "fire", which
  nothing matched. The two are
  siblings at all only because `{?ship}` and `{ship}` normalise to the same
  element. Note that the word settling the question ("to") is not the word
  `fire_to` is missing ("fire"), so answering supplies no evidence for the anchor
  that went unheard.
- **Why this is recorded rather than fixed**: in the set above both members missed
  the same two words — the shared verb `fire` and the discriminator — and the
  member that survives the bar is admitted only because a matched leading *slot*
  precedes its verb. So there, both choices fire a command whose verb went unheard.
  Suppressing the barred rival would, in a two-member set, drop the choice list
  below two — and `TryBuildAmbiguity` returns false below two choices, so the
  question would not be asked at all and the surviving member would fire anyway. A
  larger set keeps its question and simply loses an option. That narrows the
  question, not the hazard.
- **And where the discriminator *is* the barred member's anchor, gating would be
  worse.** Register `resume_fire : ["{ship}", "resume", "fire"]` and
  `cease_fire : ["{?ship}", "cease", "fire"]` and say "alpha fire": both match
  `fire`, and each misses only its *own* discriminating word, so the question
  offers "resume" or "cease" — and answering **supplies** the anchor that went
  missing. The command that fires is one whose first required element the speaker
  really did utter. Refusing barred rivals wholesale would delete that question and
  hand the round to whichever member was registered first, which is the coin flip
  `disambiguateSiblingTies` exists to replace.
- **Not the uniform case**: where the discriminating word is **every** member's
  first required element, the round's winner is barred, the round yields nothing
  and no question opens. That case is unchanged — see *Sibling patterns that
  differ at one word fire the first-registered one* below.
- **Workaround**:
  - Leave `disambiguateSiblingTies` off, which is the default.
  - Do not author one member of a sibling pair with a leading **optional** slot
    where its sibling leads with the required form; that mismatch is what makes
    the set mixed-anchored.
  - Register the barred-prone member **first**. The tie-break is deterministic, so
    that member wins the round, the bar refuses it, and the path closes outright —
    at the cost of the whole set: no command fires and no question opens for it.
  - Give the riskier intent `requiresConfirmation`.
    `PendingCommandHandler.Complete` re-enters pending on the **chosen
    alternative's own** definition, so a confirmation declared on that intent does
    apply to it.

### Default `bufferWindow` is too short for split commands on Quest 3

- **Repro**: Speak a two-part command with a deliberate mid-command pause:
  "launch missiles" ... "target hotel one". On Quest 3 the gap measured
  between VOSK results is often ~1.9–2.1s, so any window shorter than that
  flushes before the second half arrives and the command is lost. The current
  0.5s default is well short of this; even the former 1.5s default (v2.3) was
  marginal — just under the typical gap.
- **Where seen**: v2.3 test matrix Phase 4.1 (pass-with-note), Phase 8.2
  retry (v2.4), and general notes — 2.0s is a more reliable value on Quest 3.
- **Root cause**: VOSK on Quest 3 emits final results with ~0.5–1.0s latency
  after speech ends, compounding any mid-command pause the speaker takes.
  The default matches typical PC latency (1.5s in v2.3, later lowered to 0.5s
  for a snappier PC baseline); on Quest hardware the buffer needs more slack.
- **Workaround**:
  - Set `bufferWindow=2.0` in the inspector for Quest builds.
  - Do not push beyond ~2.5–3.0s: the test matrices found that long windows
    start merging genuinely unrelated utterances ("cross-command bleed").

### Utterance buffer drops split commands if the pause exceeds `bufferWindow`

- **Repro**: Pause longer than `bufferWindow` mid-command. The first half
  flushes before the second half arrives, and neither matches a pattern.
- **Where seen**: v2.3 Phase 5.3, v2.3 Phase 4.1 note.
- **Root cause**: By design — the buffer has to flush eventually or it would
  merge unrelated speech. There is no retry.
- **Workaround**:
  - Tell users to speak commands in one breath, or provide a visible "hold
    to talk" affordance that gates recognition to a single burst.
  - For conversational UX, prefer shorter patterns that complete within one
    VOSK final result.

### A command that is also a prefix of a longer one can't be both instant and split-safe

- **Repro**: Register `["fire"]` and `["fire", "at", "{target}"]`, enable
  `eagerFlushOnCompleteMatch`, then say "fire" and pause longer than
  `bufferWindow` before "at hotel one". Eager flush deliberately does *not* fire
  "fire" early (it is a prefix of the longer command), so it waits the full
  window — and if the pause exceeds it, only "fire" is recognised.
- **Root cause**: Inherent, not a bug. A complete command that is also a prefix
  of a longer command is genuinely ambiguous until either more speech arrives or
  the window expires. No time/parse strategy makes it both zero-latency and
  correct: firing instantly would drop the longer command; waiting adds latency.
  Eager flush resolves this conservatively by waiting (correctness over latency);
  non-prefix commands are unaffected and fire instantly.
- **Workaround**:
  - Set `prefixHoldSeconds` (e.g. 0.5–0.8) to bound the wait. The ambiguity is
    only over a continuation, which a continuing speaker begins almost
    immediately, so the prefix command fires after that much silence instead of
    the full `bufferWindow`. It shortens the wait rather than removing it — the
    tradeoff above is unchanged, just cheaper.
  - Use push-to-talk (`VoxrPushToTalkController`); `ReleaseTalk` calls
    `FlushPendingBuffer()`, giving the prefix command a deterministic,
    zero-latency endpoint.
  - Avoid registering commands that are exact prefixes of others when low latency
    matters — e.g. give the shorter command a distinct extra keyword.

### A spoken slot value is silently discarded when its introducing word is dropped (residual case)

> **Narrowed by #65.** Coverage (#65 §5.2) closed the common form of this: with
> `["decelerate"]` and `["decelerate", "by", "{burn_level}"]` registered,
> "decelerate hard burn" now fires the slot-filled pattern at `2/3` = `0.67` with
> the burn level extracted, where it used to fire the bare command at `1.0` and
> discard it. What remains is the case below, which coverage cannot reach.

- **Repro**: Take the pair above and additionally register any pattern that can
  *begin* on the stranded value's first word — `["hard", "stop"]` will do. Say
  "decelerate hard burn" with the "by" elided by the speaker or dropped by VOSK.
  The bare pattern fires at score 1.0 and `burn_level` is empty — the command runs
  at its default level, with nothing reporting that a burn level was heard and
  thrown away. This is at the **default** `coverageWeight` of `1.0`. The original
  form was observed in-headset; this residue is measured, not observed in the wild.
- **Root cause**: Coverage charges a candidate for what it leaves unexplained, but
  the trailing count is a *run* that stops at the first token which could begin
  another match — the rule that keeps multi-command utterances intact. When the
  stranded value's own first word is such a token, the run terminates at once, the
  bare pattern is charged nothing, and it is back to matching perfectly at `1/1` =
  `1.0` against the slot-filled `2/3` = `0.67`. No threshold or weight tuning
  reaches it: a score normalised to 1.0 is the ceiling, so nothing can outrank the
  bare pattern while it matches exactly. The same applies wherever the orphan test
  charges nothing, including a grammar with a slot-initial pattern over a
  permissive slot (see the entry above). Short unstressed function words are the
  most-dropped tokens in practice, which is what makes the shape worth avoiding
  rather than tolerating.
- **Workaround**: Mark the droppable literal optional — `["decelerate", "?by",
  "{burn_level}"]`. An omitted optional leaves both sides of the score ratio, so the
  slot-filled pattern also scores 1.0 with or without the word, and wins as the
  candidate covering more of the utterance. This still works in the residual case,
  where coverage alone does not — which is why the construction-time warning was
  deliberately *not* narrowed when coverage shipped, even though the parser now has
  the information to narrow it. Removing the literal outright
  (`["decelerate", "{burn_level}"]`) works too, at the cost of the phrasing.
- **The warning**: `VoxrCommandParser` logs it at construction, naming the literal
  and the slot at risk — in the **Editor only**, so look for it there rather than
  in a device log. The scan follows what the parser itself compares, so it covers
  the hazard across *different intents* as well as within one command, behind a run
  of two or more literals, and after expanding a bare pattern's own optional
  elements; only patterns with more than six optionals are compared unexpanded.
- **The optional-literal swap has two costs**, neither of them a no-op:
  - A matched optional literal scores 0.5 on both sides of the ratio where a
    required one scores 1.0, so any *imperfect* match scores strictly lower than
    before and may now fall under `minScore`.
  - An optional literal no longer anchors the element after it, so a following slot
    can claim adjacent tokens the literal never introduced (with
    `orient heading {heading} ?mark {?elevation}`, a stray fourth digit is absorbed
    as `elevation` and wins on span, where the required form scored 0.8 and dropped
    it). Prefer the swap where the trailing slot's vocabulary is distinct from its
    neighbours'; be careful where it is a `NumberSequence`.

### Sibling patterns that differ at one word fire the first-registered one

- **Symptom**: Two commands share every element but one — `switch to weapons` and
  `switch to navigation`, or `set {ship} mode on` and `set {ship} level on`. The
  speaker says one of them, VOSK drops the discriminating word, and the *other*
  command fires. Not an early fire: the wrong command. (With
  `disambiguateSiblingTies` on, the speaker is asked instead — see the remedy below.
  This entry describes the default, which is off.)
- **Repro**: Register both `["switch", "to", "weapons"]` and
  `["switch", "to", "navigation"]`, then feed the transcript "switch to". Both
  patterns score `(1 + 1 + 0) / 3` = 0.67, which clears the default `minScore`.
- **Root cause**: The surviving evidence fits both siblings *equally*, so they tie
  on score, on consumed span and on literal count, and selection falls through to
  its final key — registration order. The word that would have decided is exactly
  the one that went missing, so no scorer can recover the intent; the parser is
  guessing, and it guesses consistently rather than randomly.
- **Timing: the eager gate refuses on both shapes, which changes when the guess
  happens, not what fires** (with the flag off, which is the default). For a
  *trailing* discriminator it always refused — it will not commit a pattern whose
  trailing required element never matched. A discriminator in the *middle* clears
  that particular rule (`set {ship} mode on` heard as "set alpha on" scores
  `3 / 4` = 0.75 and spans the buffer) and used to commit **early** with the wrong
  sibling; the gate now declines whenever the buffer fits two different intents
  equally, one required word apart. The same command still fires at the end of
  `bufferWindow` — deferring cannot let the missing word arrive, since speech only
  appends and the position it would have occupied is already behind the match.
  What deferring buys is that the decision is made once, on a final transcript —
  **which is where the recogniser can ask you instead of guessing.** (The refusal
  is an eager-gate rule and needs `eagerFlushOnCompleteMatch`; the remedy below
  does not, and works on default settings.)
- **There is now a supported remedy: `disambiguateSiblingTies`.** With it on, a flush
  that ties this way stops guessing and asks. `OnCommandPending` raises with
  `PendingAmbiguity` set, carrying the competing commands and the one word that tells
  each apart; the speaker says that word and the right intent fires with its slots
  intact. Off by default, because an ambiguous utterance then fires *nothing* until it
  is answered — with no `OnCommandPending` subscriber that is worse than the coin flip.
  See [Ask instead of guessing](Documentation~/command-recognition.md#ambiguous-commands-ask-instead-of-guessing).
  **What the rest of this entry describes is what remains with the flag off**, which
  is the default.
- **The parser now warns about this shape at construction**, in the Editor, naming
  the intents, the patterns as authored, the differing element and the competing
  values. It reports only what it can see going wrong: two patterns of *different*
  intents (within one intent the same command dispatches either way), where the tie
  would actually clear the `minScore` configured on the recogniser, and where the
  differing word is not *every* pattern's **first required element** — where it is,
  dropping it bars whichever candidate wins the round, so nothing fires and there is
  nothing to report (see *What now works, and used to not* below). Since #140 that
  second condition reads the threshold you configured rather than a copy of the
  default, so the scan tracks your settings: lower `minScore` and the short pairs it
  makes live are reported, raise it and pairs that can no longer fire wrongly go
  quiet. See the note below for which pattern lengths that works out to. The third
  condition reads no threshold at all and is unaffected either way.
- **Workaround**: Turn on `disambiguateSiblingTies` and prompt from
  `OnCommandPending`, which is the only remedy that keeps both phrasings and still
  gets the right command. Where you cannot prompt: make the two commands differ in
  **more than one element**, so losing one word still leaves another to decide
  (`arm weapons` / `show navigation`, not `switch to weapons` /
  `switch to navigation`); or move the differing word to the front, so it is **every**
  pattern's **first required element** — dropping it then bars whichever candidate
  wins the round and that round yields nothing, which buys silence instead of a wrong
  command at the price of the speaker having to say it again, does nothing for an
  utterance where the word *was* heard, and correctly silences the construction-time
  warning for that pair (see *What now works, and used to not* below) — note it also
  puts that pair beyond `disambiguateSiblingTies`, since the round yields nothing and
  no pending opens for the speaker to be asked from; or give the
  more destructive of the pair `requiresConfirmation`; or — where both phrasings must
  exist verbatim — register the safer one first, since the tie-break is deterministic.
- **What now works, and used to not**: moving the difference *earlier* in the
  pattern, so the differing word is each pattern's **first required element**.
  `weapons mode` and `navigation mode` still tie at `0.5`, and `weapons mode active`
  against `navigation mode active` still ties at `0.67` — but dropping a leading
  required element now bars whichever of the two wins the round, at any pattern
  length, so the outcome is silence rather than the wrong command. Note what it buys
  and what it does not: silence instead of a wrong action,
  with the speaker having to repeat themselves, and no help at all on an utterance
  where the discriminating word *was* heard. It also stops the construction-time
  warning above reporting that pair, correctly — the claim that warning makes would
  no longer be true of it — so a warning that vanishes when you apply this is the
  remedy landing, not the pair going away.
- **Note**: This shape predates the current miss cost. At four or more elements it
  already cleared the gate; reducing the miss cost extends it down to three-element
  patterns, which is where two-word-prefix grammars live. Those lengths are read off
  the `minScore` you configured — at the default `0.6` a three-element pattern's
  `0.67` clears and a two-element pattern's `0.5` does not; lower the threshold and
  shorter pairs become live and are reported. That reach stops only where
  the differing word leads **every** pattern in the set — there the round's winner is
  barred and nothing fires at any length, per the entry above. Where it leads some but
  not all of them the reach still holds, because the round can be handed to a
  candidate the bar does not touch.

### A pattern with more than six optional elements is not checked for siblings

- **Symptom**: A grammar carries the sibling shape above and **no construction-time
  warning is logged** — while an otherwise identical grammar with one fewer optional
  element warns as expected. With `disambiguateSiblingTies` on, the tie is also not
  offered as a question. (The eager-flush gate still refuses on this repro, for the
  reason below — but it is not exempt in general either.)
- **First check it is this entry at all.** A missing sibling warning has a
  *second* cause, and it has nothing to do with optional elements: where the
  discriminating word is **every** member pattern's **first required element**,
  the warning is withheld on purpose — dropping that word bars whichever
  candidate wins the round, so nothing fires and there is nothing to report.
  Look at the discriminating word before you count optional elements: if it
  leads every pattern in the set, that deliberate withholding is what you are
  seeing and this entry does not apply. See *Sibling patterns that differ at
  one word fire the first-registered one* above.
- **Repro**: Register `["engage", "?a", "?b", "?c", "?d", "?e", "?f", "?g",
  "shields", "online"]` against `["engage", "weapons", "online"]` and say
  "engage online". Remove any one of the seven optionals and the same utterance
  behaves differently.
- **Root cause**: Deciding whether two patterns are siblings means comparing every
  reading of each — a pattern with `N` optional elements has `2^N` of them — so past
  six the **set-building scan** stops expanding and takes the pattern only **as
  authored**, `?` markers and all. (An optional *slot* still folds with its required
  form for comparison; an optional *literal* `?word` buckets only with another
  literal `?word`.) It still builds a set from that reading — two patterns spelling
  the same seven optionals and differing at one word are still warned about — but a
  relation visible only in some expanded reading is never seen, and the repro above
  is that case. That bound was set when the comparison fed nothing but
  an Editor warning, where it cost recall on one message. It now also feeds runtime
  behaviour, so an unexpanded pattern's relations are *unknown* rather than absent.
- **What the parser does about it**: it does not assume, and this is a *second*
  mechanism rather than the same one. Where the set-building scan gave up, the
  **runtime pair test** falls back to comparing the two patterns' required elements —
  the all-optionals-omitted reading — which is a real reading the matcher can produce.
  So the eager gate still refuses to commit on such a pair. A relation visible only in
  some *middle* reading is the part that stays invisible to both.
- **Where seen**: repository test suite, eager-commit coverage for the expansion cap.
- **With `disambiguateSiblingTies` on, such a rival is never offered as a choice.**
  That fallback proves the two patterns tie but cannot say *which word* tells them
  apart, and without that word there is no question to phrase. If it is the only rival,
  the flush fires the winner exactly as it would with the flag off; if another rival
  makes a question happen anyway, the unnameable one is missing from the list and
  `PendingAmbiguity.IsTruncated` says so, so you can offer "…or say the whole command
  again".
- **Workaround**: Keep patterns under seven optional elements, which is well inside
  normal authoring. If you need more, do not also rely on a single required word to
  separate two intents — that combination is the one this cannot see.
- **Note**: This bound (6) is deliberately lower than the one that governs
  eager-flush eligibility (12). The sibling comparison runs at construction on every
  parser rebuild in the Editor — and in a player build whenever
  `disambiguateSiblingTies` is on; a flag-off player builds the lookup lazily from
  the eager path — where the eligibility analysis is always lazy.

### Two intents on duplicate or overlapping patterns: the second can never fire, and nothing warns

- **Symptom**: Two commands carry the same pattern (or patterns that overlap
  completely on an utterance). The first-registered intent fires every time, at a
  clean score; the other is permanently dead. No construction-time warning is
  logged, and a batch run shows a healthy `1.00` PASS for the winner.
- **Repro**: Register `["shields", "up"]` under `raise_shields`, then again under
  `activate_defence`. Say "shields up" — `raise_shields` fires, always.
- **Root cause**: The two candidates tie on every selection key — same start, same
  score, same span, same literal count — and a tie keeps the incumbent, so
  registration order decides permanently. The sibling machinery does not apply:
  both the construction-time warning and `disambiguateSiblingTies` require the
  patterns to differ at exactly **one** position, and these differ at none — there
  is no discriminating word to warn about, and no word the speaker could answer
  with.
- **Detection**: the Editor names the rival since
  [#95](https://github.com/jinwoo1601/VoXR-Speech-Recognition/issues/95). The debug
  window's last-match breakdown and the Batch Test Runner's per-row diagnostics
  show a `Tied with:` line reading `— not a sibling; check for duplicate or
  overlapping patterns` whenever a rival scored exactly as well as the winner. The
  exported session log records the same finding per attempt, as `tiedRival` and
  `tiedRivalIsSibling`, so a whole playtest can be swept for it after the fact.
- **Workaround**: This is a grammar defect rather than a recognition limitation —
  remove the duplicate pattern, or differentiate the two in more than one element.
  If two intents genuinely share a phrasing, register the pattern under one intent
  and branch in your handler.

### Confidence of `-1.00` means "no data", not "zero confidence"

- **Repro**: Inject text through `InjectText` without a `VoxrWord[]`, or take
  any result VOSK delivered with no per-word data. The logged per-command
  confidence is `-1.00`.
- **Where seen**: v2.1 Phase 2.3 (triggered the bug that introduced the
  sentinel), v2.2 Phase 6.2, v2.3 Phase 3.2–3.3, v2.4 Phase 3.8.
- **Root cause**: The aggregate is the *minimum* per-word confidence over the
  matched span, never an average. When no per-word confidence is available for
  that span, there is nothing to take the minimum of, so the parser returns
  `-1.0` as a sentinel meaning "no data" and `VoxrCommandRecogniser` treats
  this as *not subject to* `minConfidence`, so the command still fires based
  on pattern-match score. A leading `[unk]` run is **not** a cause — selection
  never starts a match on `[unk]`, so a winning span always holds at least one
  matched word. See
  [Matching and Scoring](Documentation~/scoring.md#minconfidence-default-04)
  for the second, less obvious way `-1` arises.
  Without this sentinel (v2.0 used raw `0.0`), genuine noise that drove
  confidence to 0 was indistinguishable from "no data" and either bypassed
  the threshold or was falsely rejected.
- **Workaround**: None needed. If you display confidence in a debug UI,
  treat `-1.00` specially ("no data" / "n/a"), not as "zero".

## Hardware Audio

Limitations specific to capturing audio on target hardware. These are
pre-solved inside `NativeBridge~` but are worth documenting because they
constrain how the native layer is structured and will matter again on any
future device port.

### AAudio input delivers silence on Quest 3 — must use Java AudioRecord

- **Repro**: Build the SDK with `audio_capture_aaudio.cpp` as the active
  capture backend. `AAudioStream` opens and starts without error and
  callbacks fire on schedule, but the audio buffer is near-zero regardless
  of input preset (`GENERIC`, `VOICE_RECOGNITION`, `UNPROCESSED`).
- **Where seen**: Quest 3 bring-up (2026-03-31).
- **Root cause**: Platform-specific AAudio input bug on Quest 3 firmware.
  The native layer switched to the Java `AudioRecord` API via JNI
  (`audio_capture_audiorecord.cpp`), which routes correctly to the headset
  microphone. The old AAudio implementation is retained for reference.
- **Workaround**: Already applied — the shipped build uses AudioRecord. If
  porting to another Android device, test AAudio first; it may work outside
  Quest 3. Do not remove the AAudio files; they are a fallback seed.

### `vosk_recognizer_accept_waveform_f` is broken on prebuilt arm64 `libvosk.so`

- **Repro**: Feed float samples directly to VOSK via
  `vosk_recognizer_accept_waveform_f`. Audio levels reach the library
  correctly, but every recognition result is empty.
- **Where seen**: Quest 3 bring-up.
- **Root cause**: Bug in the prebuilt arm64 `libvosk.so` — the int16 entry
  point (`vosk_recognizer_accept_waveform_s`) works, but the float entry
  point does not produce usable output. Not investigated upstream; likely a
  build-config issue in Alphacephei's prebuilt.
- **Workaround**: Already applied — `vosk_bridge.cpp` converts float samples
  to int16 before feeding VOSK. If you rebuild `libvosk.so` yourself, retest
  the float path before switching to it — the workaround cost is one extra
  copy per buffer, which is negligible.

### Quest 3 microphone gain is low; AGC is applied before VOSK

- **Repro**: Capture raw samples from Quest 3's `VOICE_RECOGNITION` source
  while speaking at normal volume. Peak levels sit around 0.04–0.4 on a
  `[-1, 1]` scale.
- **Where seen**: Quest 3 bring-up.
- **Root cause**: Quest 3's mic pipeline outputs conservatively low levels
  — likely intentional headroom for louder-than-expected input — but this
  leaves VOSK's acoustic frontend operating near its noise floor for quiet
  speech.
- **Workaround**: Already applied — an AGC stage in `vosk_bridge.cpp`
  targets a configurable dB level before converting to int16. The target is
  exposed on `VoxrSpeechRecogniser` as the `micGainTargetDb` inspector field
  (default `-18 dB`, calibrated for Quest 3). Tune it if you observe clipping
  or under-gain on a different device.

## Notes

This file is meant to grow as we discover more limitations. When adding a new
entry, follow the existing structure: short repro, where seen (test matrix
reference if applicable), root cause, workaround. Group entries by category —
the categories above are a starting point but feel free to add more (e.g.
"Threading", "Build/Deploy") as needed.

Version-shaped references here come from two separate namespaces, and the
shape tells them apart rather than the range. A `v`-prefixed **two**-part
number — `v2.1`, `v2.0` — is one of the project's internal pre-1.0 verification
phases. That holds whether or not the surrounding text says "test matrix
Phase": several entries cite a phase in passing, as in "(v2.0 used raw
`0.0`)". A **three**-part number — `1.4.0`, `2.0.0` — is a package release, and
every one of those has its own dated section in `CHANGELOG.md`. The two
numbering schemes ran independently and any overlap between them is
coincidence. Issue numbers (`#65`, `#82`, …) refer to the GitHub issue that
introduced or changed the behaviour.
