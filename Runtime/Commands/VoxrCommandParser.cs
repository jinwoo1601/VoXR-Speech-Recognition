        // words are the most dropped tokens in practice — and the longer pattern loses that
        // element's credit while still counting it in its denominator, so it drops below the
        // perfectly-matching P, which wins and the spoken slot content is discarded with
        // nothing to signal it. Issue #65 §5.1 reduced that loss (a drop now costs 1/N rather
        // than 1.5/N) but could not close it, and no penalty tuning could: P scored a clean
        // 1.0 and nothing normalized to 1.0 can beat it. Marking the literal optional does —
        // an omitted optional leaves both sides of the ratio, so the longer pattern reaches
        // 1.0 whether or not the literal was spoken and takes the consumed-span tie-break
        // (issue #41) over the bare form.
        //
        // §5.2 CLOSED THE COMMON CASE, so the paragraph above is now the history of this
        // detector rather than its reason. Coverage charges P for what it leaves unexplained,
        // which is exactly the stranded slot value: bare "decelerate" on "decelerate hard
        // burn" falls from 1.0 to 1/(1+2) and loses to the longer pattern's 2/3.
        //
        // The hazard is REDUCED, not eliminated, and the residue is what this still warns
        // about. An orphan run stops at the first token that could begin some other pattern,
        // so when the stranded value's first word happens to start one, P is charged nothing
        // and strands the value exactly as before — register ["hard","stop"] beside the pair
        // above and "hard" becomes such a token.
        //
        // Deliberately NOT narrowed to that residue, though _startLiterals/_startSlots could
        // now answer it. The remedy is the better authoring either way: an optional literal
        // reaches 1.0 rather than 2/3, so it wins by more, and it also wins in the residual
        // case where coverage alone does not.
        //
        // The scan mirrors what ParseInternal actually compares, which is why it is this wide:
        //   - ACROSS COMMANDS, not just within one. Selection runs over every pattern of every
        //     command through a single CompareCandidate, so splitting the two phrasings across
        //     two intents reproduces the hazard exactly.
        //   - Over a RUN of required literals, not a single one. Dropping any one word in
        //     "decelerate by the {burn_level}" strands the value just as "by" alone does.
        //   - Over EXPANDED optional forms, like ComputeCanCommitEarly's prefix analysis, so a
        //     bare pattern that only becomes a prefix once its own optional is omitted still
        //     counts ("fire {?quantity} {weapon}" vs "fire {weapon} at {target}").
        // Widening cost was measured on the 11-intent/32-pattern demo grammar: 0 warnings for
        // every variant, and exactly the one expected warning on the pre-#42 grammar.
        //
        // The remedy is not free, and the message must not imply it is: an optional literal
        // scores OptionalLiteralScore on both sides rather than MatchScore, so any match that
        // is already imperfect scores strictly lower than the required form would —
        // (r-0.5)/(d-0.5) < r/d for r < d. It also stops anchoring the element after it, which
        // can then claim adjacent tokens the literal never introduced.
        //
        // EDITOR-ONLY as of issue #81. §5.2 demoted this from a hazard every such grammar
        // carries to a residue most of them do not, while it went on firing on every parser
        // construction — in shipped builds, and again on every SetActiveSets rebuild (see the
        // "Validation warnings re-emit on every active-set switch" limitation, which this
        // compounded). A warning that loud on grammars that now behave correctly is the kind
        // that gets globally suppressed, taking the residual case with it. The TRIGGER stays at
        // full breadth, for three reasons. The remedy is the better authoring either way and
        // does reach the residue coverage alone does not — though it is not the only edit that
        // does: removing the literal outright reaches it too, scoring the same 1.0 and taking
        // the same span tie-break, at the cost of the phrasing. A narrowing here could consult
        // only _startLiterals/_startSlots, which answer CanStartPattern; the orphan run
        // actually terminates on the strictly wider IsAdmissibleStart (issue #82), so a
        // construction-time trigger would go silent on every position the cheap test declines.

        //   - It only ever ADDS claims. CanStartPattern is consulted first and is never
        //     overruled, so a pattern that begins here keeps terminating the run whatever DR-7
        //     would say about the candidate — which is the half of F11 that
        //     Coverage_ResidualHazard_WhenTheStrandedValueBeginsAPattern pins.
